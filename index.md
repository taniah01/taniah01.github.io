### CPSC 120

* Lab 2

   Lab 2, part 1 was one of my favorite labs because the 
   purpose of this lab was to identify messy programs. It 
   taught me that even if a program runs, it is still 
   importantthat it is formatted correctly in order to 
   look nice and of consideration for other programmers. 
   If someone needed to collaborate with you on your program it 
   makes it easier for them to read your work when it is neatly organized. 

* Lab 3

    Lab 3, part 3 was one of my favorite labs because it was 
    my first time creating a game. During this lab is where I 
    learned how to implement if statements in order for my program 
    to work. Ultimately, it was fun testing out this program and 
    interacting with it when guessing the correct number. 

* Lab 5

    Lab 5, part 2 was one of my favorite labs because I liked 
    how the program incorporated math with programming. I like 
    when different topics are combined together to form something. 
    Also, this was my first time implementing loops in my program 
    and I learned how they come in handy in programming.
